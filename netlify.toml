## Netlify configuration for Brew Bloom Coffee Shop (Django)
##
## IMPORTANT: Netlify is primarily for static sites and Jamstack apps.
## This configuration will:
## - Install dependencies
## - Run Django migrations
## - Collect static files
## - Publish ONLY the collected static files
##
## Your dynamic Django views (checkout, auth, admin, etc.) will NOT run
## on Netlify alone; you will need a separate backend host for full
## functionality. Netlify here is best used just for static marketing pages
## or assets unless you integrate another Python backend service.

[build]
  # Pure static deploy: serve files from the "static" directory
  # No Python / Django build step is run on Netlify.
  command = "echo 'Static build – no server-side code'"
  publish = "static"

[build.environment]
  ## Set any Django settings here, and also in the Netlify UI:
  ## DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, DJANGO_DEBUG, DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS, etc.

## Example: redirect everything to index (for a SPA front-end). Not needed for Django templates.
## [[redirects]]
##   from = "/*"
##   to = "/index.html"
##   status = 200
